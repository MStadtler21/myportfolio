            <p>
             I am a web developer from Munich, Germany currently residing in Colorado.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have spent the last 12 years working in kitchens in a variety of positions. From starting as a dishwasher at 15 years old, to becoming a Sous Chef at an award winning restaurant, I have never stopped growing and finding new things to be passionate about.

            I was always interested in the behind the scenes of the internet and the business that made it all work. But having a career that I considered to be untouchable always kept me from exploring a career in Web Development.

            <p>
            Like so many others, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted my idea of what my career was, but I saw an opportunity to finally learn the skills that I needed to build a career in web development. I enrolled at the University of Denver's Web Development Bootcamp and began devoting myself to learning JavaScript. Please enjoy my portfolio and do not hesitate to contact me with any requests for web development services.

            <p>
            In my free time I enjoy cooking for friends and family, building PC's, and collecting cookbooks!
